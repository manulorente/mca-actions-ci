## GitFlow development

Once workflows are defined, we can start developing our application. We will use GitFlow as a branching model. This model is based on two main branches with infinite life:

```sh
    git flow init -d
```

Push changes to develop branch to trigger the workflow:

```sh
    git push --set-upstream origin develop
```
